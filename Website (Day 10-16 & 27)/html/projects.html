                                    During my Introduction to Cryptography course, my professor gave the class the freedom to use the programming language of their choice for the homework assignments.
                                    I used this opportunity to learn a new language: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lua_(programming_language)" target="_blank">Lua</a>. While this was an exciting challenge at the start, it quickly became a problem when we started working
                                    with numbers too large to fit in the primitive data types. Most languages have a way of overcoming this problem. For example, Java allows users to declare
                                    BigInteger types and Python automatically converts numbers to BigIntegers once they are too large. However, Lua has no native support for any such feature. So, I
                                    took it upon myself to create an entirely new data type for Lua, ensuring that every operation possible in Java would be possible in Lua. After typing over 1000
                                    lines of math-intensive code, I was finally able to complete my homework assignments for my Cryptography class using Lua.

                                    Over the summer of 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, a friend from college challenged
                                    me to do the 100 days of code challenge. The gist of the challenge was to code for one
                                    hour a day, 100 days in a row. Considering the fact that I was quarantined at home, I accepted
                                    the challenge. I used this time to complete some abandonded projects. Among those projects, was
                                    a varient of the videogame Minesweeper, where the numbers are replaced by randomized symbols.
                                    I originally was going to make the final product text-based, but that was not a user friendly
                                    solution. So, I went for the GUI (Graphical User Interface) approach instead. I had a fully playable
                                    game in only a couple of days, but I decided to go above my original plans by adding many features
                                    that I found lacking from the original Minesweeper. This was entertaining to code, and the end
                                    result provided me with a form of entertainment.

                                <div class="storyText">
                                    After the conclusion of my first year at Towson University, I took on the rather ambitious
                                    task of creating a password manager. At the time, I had a basic understand of Java and figured
                                    that whatever I made would be good enough. However, looking back, I made many severe mistakes:
                                    I stored the master password as plaintext in the code, used a substitution cipher instead
                                    of a modern encryption algorithim, and made no effort to make the program user friendly.
                                    So, two years later, I revisited the idea of a password manager, aiming to correct my previous
                                    shortcomings. The one you are seeing on this website uses the Advanced Encryption
                                    Algorithim (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard" target="_blank">AES</a>), which is currently the most secure symmetric encryption algorithim. Additionally, the
                                    master password acts as a key to unencrypt a file that contains the passwords. This means
                                    that the master password is not stored in the code, because the user can set it to be whatever
                                    they want. Lastly, managing the passwords is easily done with the four built in functions:
                                    search, add, remove, and modify. While working on this project for a second time, it was easy to
                                    notice the growth in my understanding of coding, which made for a satisfying time.
