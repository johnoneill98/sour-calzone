                During my Introduction to Cryptography course, my professor gave the class the freedom to use the programming language of their choice for the homework assignments.
                I used this opportunity to learn a new language: Lua. While this was an exciting challenge at the start, it quickly became a problem when we started working
                with numbers too large to fit in the primitive data types. Most languages have a way of overcoming this problem. For example, Java allows users to declare
                BigInteger types and Python automatically converts numbers to BigIntegers once they are too large. However, Lua has no native support for any such feature. So, I
                took it upon myself to create an entirely new data type for Lua, using Java's implementation as reference. After typing over 1000 lines of math-intensive code, I was
                finally able to complete my homework assignments for my Cryptography class using Lua.
