### Log
* 06/10/2020 (Day 1) - Downloaded and refamiliarized myself with how to use Java Swing
* 06/11/2020 (Day 2) - Converted an application that was previously text based into a GUI. Allows me to pick a random video game from a list of video games I haven't beaten but own.
* 06/12/2020 (Day 3) - Continued to work on yesterday's project. Added a way to switch between light/dark mode, as well as a way to edit the games list from within the application.
* 06/13/2020 (Day 4) - Began work on making a graphic Minesweeper. Completed the generation of the board as well as the ability to reveal single tiles. I also added a toolbar that doesn't do anything yet! But it will eventually.
* 06/14/2020 (Day 5) - I cheated today and coded way more than an hour. I implemented cascading of revealing tiles, added color options, added a way to flag a tile, added messages to say when a game is won/lost, and added a way for the field to reset. It's technically a fully playable game of minesweeper, but I still want to spruce it up a bit. I also get a stack overflow error when I play a second game after playing a first game and not losing immediately. I'm not sure why, but I'll figure it out.
* 06/15/2020 (Day 6) - Added a random color option, changed the pop-up menus, and added an action menu to the toolbar
* 06/16/2020 (Day 7) - Changed the text for tiles with a randomized image, making the game way harder. The text is still an option if the icons array is set to null, which is something I'm going to take advantage of once I figure out how to get user input for the size/difficulty of the game. I could just do it through args in main, but that isn't very user friendly.
* 06/17/2020 (Day 8) - Fixed stack overflow. Added field customization.
* 06/18/2020 (Day 9) - Improved field customization. Improved end game screens. Implemented custom colors. Fully finished with this project (this is also my second time updating this readMe. The first time has much more personality).
* 06/19/2020 (Day 10) - Fixed bug with minesweeper that made the flags dissapeared when changing the icon color. Refamiliarized myself with the work I have done on my website so that I can hopefully finish it before day 100.
* 06/20/2020 (Day 11) - Skipped
* 06/21/2020 (Day 12) - Skipped
* 06/22/2020 (Day 13) - Since I skipped the last couple of days, I decided to do three hours today instead of one. The plan is still to work on the website, so the first thing I did was reinstall Visual Studio. While that was going on, I looked into how to embed Java code onto a website. After an hour of no progress, I chose to come back to that another day. I did however, complete a slideshow of projects at the bottom of the home page. There are three pictures with captions. With that, I think the home page is finally complete! And yes, that took the entire remaining 2 hours. HTML, css, and Javascript are something I have not used in a hot minute.
* 06/23/2020 (Day 14) - Finished the contact page and began work on the projects page.
* 06/24/2020 (Day 15) - Continued work on the projects page. I have a pretty good skeleton of what I want, but I'm thinking I'll probably add more room for pictures at some point. I want only one project visible at a time, and pictures seem like a good way to fill space. Maybe I'll do a slideshow? I don't know yet!
* 06/25/2020 (Day 16) - Changed the projects page to be one big slideshow, with mini slideshows on each slide. I completed the first slide and second slides, BigInteger.lua and Minesweeper respectively.
* 06/26/2020 (Day 17) - Password Manager
* 06/27/2020 (Day 18) - Password Manager
* 06/28/2020 (Day 19) - Password Manager
* 06/29/2020 (Day 20) - Password Manager
* 06/30/2020 (Day 21) - Password Manager
* 06/31/2020 (Day 22) - Password Manager
* 06/01/2020 (Day 23) - Password Manager
* 06/02/2020 (Day 24) - Password Manager
* 06/03/2020 (Day 25) - Password Manager
* 06/04/2020 (Day 26) - Uh... I made password manager so that I have something to demonstrate on my website that I understand encryption algorithims. It sort of counts as completing an abandonded project, because I made one a couple of years ago that was functional but used a substitution cipher instead of actual encryption. Now I can say that I've done it correctly, even if there are some more subtle security flaws I overlooked. Anyway, back to the website!
