### Log
* 06/10/2020 (Day 1) - Downloaded and refamiliarized myself with how to use Java Swing
* 06/11/2020 (Day 2) - Converted an application that was previously text based into a GUI. Allows me to pick a random video game from a list of video games I haven't beaten but own.
* 06/12/2020 (Day 3) - Continued to work on yesterday's project. Added a way to switch between light/dark mode, as well as a way to edit the games list from within the application.
* 06/13/2020 (Day 4) - Began work on making a graphic Minesweeper. Completed the generation of the board as well as the ability to reveal single tiles. I also added a toolbar that doesn't do anything yet! But it will eventually.
* 06/14/2020 (Day 5) - I cheated today and coded way more than an hour. I implemented cascading of revealing tiles, added color options, added a way to flag a tile, added messages to say when a game is won/lost, and added a way for the field to reset. It's technically a fully playable game of minesweeper, but I still want to spruce it up a bit. I also get a stack overflow error when I play a second game after playing a first game and not losing immediately. I'm not sure why, but I'll figure it out.
* 06/15/2020 (Day 6) - Added a random color option, changed the pop-up menus, and added an action menu to the toolbar
* 06/16/2020 (Day 7) - Changed the text for tiles with a randomized image, making the game way harder. The text is still an option if the icons array is set to null, which is something I'm going to take advantage of once I figure out how to get user input for the size/difficulty of the game. I could just do it through args in main, but that isn't very user friendly.
