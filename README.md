### Log
* 06/10/2020 (Day 1) - Downloaded and refamiliarized myself with how to use Java Swing
* 06/11/2020 (Day 2) - Converted an application that was previously text based into a GUI. Allows me to pick a random video game from a list of video games I haven't beaten but own.
* 06/12/2020 (Day 3) - Continued to work on yesterday's project. Added a way to switch between light/dark mode, as well as a way to edit the games list from within the application.
* 06/13/2020 (Day 4) - Began work on making a graphic Minesweeper. Completed the generation of the board as well as the ability to reveal single tiles. I also added a toolbar that doesn't do anything yet! But it will eventually.
